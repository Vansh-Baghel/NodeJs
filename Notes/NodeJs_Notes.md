# NodeJs
## What is node js
* It is not a program but a JavaScript runtime to run JS on a server.
* JavaScript runtime is the browser where we run the code.

## What it does 
* It helps to read the HTML file from the server files when request is made by any http and then send the response back to the client.

## Asynchronous Nature of NodeJs
* Node js is Single Threaded means if there are millions of users and if one user is doing any function on it , then other users have to wait unless it finishes.
* By making the code asynchronous , the function will run in the background and once its completed , it will run for the user . 
* This will solve time problem.
